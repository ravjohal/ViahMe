Your satisfaction is important to them and as such you will get your choice of color for both horse and carriage whenever possible. Inquire for possible options! All of our carriage drivers are competent and well trained with many years of horse and carriage experience. Our drivers groom and take care of the horse and make sure they are in good health. They also maintain their carriage and follow a dress code. We often decorate our carriages subtly with flowers and lace etc.., depending on the season or occasion. Our particular vis-à-vis carriages have doors for added protection for children and toddlers. This style of carriage is a convertible, so if it starts raining our passengers stay dry. To ensure further safety the horses have had plenty of experience with very busy streets and the carriages are equipped with flashers for traffic safety.<span class="more-links"><a title="Read More about Top Hand Ranch" href="javascript:void()" onclick="javascript:openFullDescriptionWeb(this)">Read more</a></span></p></div></div><div class="btn-outer"><div class="lt-buttons"><p></p></div><div class="rt-buttons"><ul>

All of us have a passion for horses and everything involved with them. One of the operators involved with the business also has a passion for photography, specializing in photography of equine events. He loves to photograph our events and can usually have a CD printed at the conclusion of your event with the pictures he has taken, for an additional fee. Our carriage, horse and wagons can be decorated by you or by us with specified colors and/or flowers, for an additional fee, with advanced agreement. We are based out of Elverta, CA, which is just North of Sacramento. We will travel to your location of choice, however, depending on the length of the drive, the price of our services may increase. Our hours of operation are determined by the needs of our customers and the availability of the horse, carriage and driver.
