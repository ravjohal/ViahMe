As a South Asian couple in America, we’re totally overwhelmed. Our parents are talking about 500 guests and 5-day celebrations, but we just want something beautiful, culturally respectful, and—most importantly—within our budget.

We looked through the Viah Me app (analyzing the onboarding flow and logic you’ve built). Here is our "honest" feedback from the perspective of a couple who has no idea where to start and is trying to save every dollar.

1. The "First Impression" Feedback
The Good:

The Budget Guide: Honestly, this is the most helpful part. Seeing that $150–$300 per guest "Rule of Thumb" immediately gave us a reality check. Most apps just ask "What's your budget?" and we have no idea what a "normal" number even is.

The Traditions: We love that it’s not just "Indian." Seeing "Sikh," "Muslim," and "South Indian" made us feel like the app actually gets us.

The UI: It feels premium. Even though we’re DIY-ing to save money, we don't want the wedding to look cheap. The Playfair Display and Cormorant fonts make it feel like a luxury experience.

The "Scary" Parts:

The "Mixed" Button: One of us is Punjabi Sikh and the other is Hindu. When we clicked "Mixed," we were hoping for more guidance. Right now, it feels like we just get a "general" list, but we’re actually trying to figure out how to do two ceremonies in one day without spending double the money.

2. How to Improve (The "DIY Couple" Wishlist)
A. The "Auntie-Proof" Guest List Tool
We are terrified of the guest list expanding.

Improvement: In the guest count section, add a "Budget vs. Guest Count" toggle. Show us in real-time: "If you cut 50 guests, you save roughly $10,000." Seeing that trade-off visually would help us say "No" to our parents' long-lost friends.

B. Explainer Tooltips (The "Wait, what's that?" factor)
We grew up here. We know we need a "Mandap" or a "Grathni," but we don't know the specifics.

Improvement: In the "Tradition" step, add a small info icon (ℹ️) that explains the cost of that tradition. For example: "Sikh weddings usually involve a Gurdwara, which can save you $5k–$10k compared to a hotel ballroom ceremony."

C. The "Hidden Costs" Warning
Since we are DIY, we’re going to miss things like service charges (22%!!), taxes, and tips.

Improvement: On the Budget Planning screen, include a small disclaimer: "Don't forget to set aside 15% for 'hidden costs' like tips and service fees."

D. Vendor "Vetting" for DIY-ers
DIY couples usually look for "diamond in the rough" vendors—people who are great but don't charge "Wedding Industry" premiums.

Improvement: In the Location step, ask: "Are you looking for All-Inclusive Venues or DIY-Friendly Venues (bring your own catering)?" Bringing our own catering is the #1 way we plan to save money.

E. The "Sub-Tradition" Integration
As we discussed earlier, "Hindu" is too broad.

Improvement: Make sure that after we pick "Hindu," the app immediately asks for the region. If we're Bengali, we don't want to see tasks for a Punjabi Choora ceremony. It just adds clutter to our DIY brain.

3. Technical "Small Wins" for the Onboarding
Location: You only have 7 metro areas. We are in Houston (one of the biggest Desi hubs!). You need a "Can't find my city" or an "Other" option that allows us to type in a zip code.

The Date: If we haven't picked a date because we're looking for the "cheapest" month (like a Friday in November), let us select "I’m flexible / looking for off-peak dates."

The Verdict
We would definitely use this over a generic app like The Knot because it feels like it was built for our culture. If you add more "Education" (explaining the rituals) and "Cost-Saving Tips" directly into the onboarding, you’ll have us hooked.

"Can you help us figure out a 3-day timeline that doesn't cost $100k? That's what we really need the app to do next!"
