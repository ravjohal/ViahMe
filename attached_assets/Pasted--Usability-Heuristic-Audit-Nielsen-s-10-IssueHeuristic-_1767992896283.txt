 Usability Heuristic Audit (Nielsen’s 10)IssueHeuristic ViolatedSeverityFixAmbiguous "Allocated" vs "Budget": The top bar shows "Total Budget" ($131k) but the table shows "Total Allocated" ($114k). It's unclear if I'm over or under.Visibility of System StatusMajorUse a single "Unallocated" pill to show exactly how much of the total budget hasn't been assigned to a category yet.The "How to Use" Wall of Text: Users must read a paragraph at the bottom to understand how to interact with the grid.Help & DocumentationMinorReplace the text block with "Empty State" prompts inside the table cells or tooltips on headers.Category vs. Ceremony Conflict: Tracking by both simultaneously is powerful but creates "Decision Paralysis."Flexibility & EfficiencyMajorAllow a toggle view: "View by Ceremony" OR "View by Category," rather than a 2D matrix which is hard to read.Tiny Touch Targets: The cells in the matrix (especially the "-" symbols) are too small for mobile or imprecise clicking.Error PreventionCriticalIncrease cell padding. Ensure the entire cell is the hit area, not just the text.Information Density: The table uses small fonts, multiple colors (Green, Orange, Grey), and symbols simultaneously.Aesthetic & Minimalist DesignMajorUse a "Signal-to-Noise" approach. Hide the "-" symbols; only show data where it exists to reduce visual clutter.2. Behavioral Science & Interaction CostFriction ReportThe Matrix Maze: The 2D grid requires the user to track their eye horizontally and vertically simultaneously. This is the highest form of Cognitive Load. Users will likely misalign a row and column and enter data in the wrong cell.Instructional Overload: The "Two Ways to Track" yellow box is a "Point of Friction." If you have to explain the UI with a 3-sentence tip, the architecture is not intuitive enough.The Hidden "Action": It isn't immediately obvious how to add a new expense. Is it a button? Or do I have to click a specific cell in the grid?Simplification Strategy (The "Progressive Disclosure" Approach)Reduce steps by 20%: Eliminate the 2D matrix as the primary view.Propose: Use a "Drill-Down" List. Show a list of Ceremonies. Clicking a Ceremony expands it to show categories. This removes the need for a horizontal scroll and lets the user focus on one event at a time (linear processing vs. spatial processing).
