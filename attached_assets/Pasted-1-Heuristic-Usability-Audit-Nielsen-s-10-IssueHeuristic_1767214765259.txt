1. Heuristic Usability Audit (Nielsen’s 10)IssueHeuristic ViolatedSeverityFixWorkflow vs. Result: Users must switch between Guest Management (planning) and Guest List (viewing). This splits the "mental model."User control and freedomMajorMerge the "Final" list and "Planning" tools into one view with a "Planning Mode" toggle or sidebar.Ambiguous Tab Names: Tabs like "Suggestions," "Collector," and "Compare" have overlapping meanings for non-tech users.Consistency and standardsMajorUse action-oriented labels: "Review Family Adds," "Manage Links," "View Guest List."High Density Stats: 4-5 colorful stat cards with different gradients and icons create high visual noise.Aesthetic and minimalist designMinorConsolidate stats into a single "Capacity Bar" showing Confirmed / Remaining / Budgeted.Mapping Complexity: The CSV/Excel mapping tool is a major technical hurdle for non-savvy users.Flexibility and efficiency of useCriticalProvide a downloadable "ViahMe Template" and an "Auto-Detect" feature that handles 90% of South Asian naming conventions.2. Behavioral Science & Interaction AuditVisual Hierarchy & Cognitive Load:The current guest-management.tsx uses a 5-step workflow stepper. While helpful for power users, it creates Decision Paralysis for a DIY couple. The "What-If Lists" feature is powerful but adds high interaction cost for someone just trying to add "Uncle Bobby."Friction Report:The "Add Guest" vs "Suggest Guest" Loop: Having separate flows for the couple to add a guest and a family member to suggest one creates two different UI patterns for the same outcome (adding a row to a database).Mapping Friction: The guest-import-dialog.tsx requires users to understand "Column Mapping"—a concept foreign to non-tech users.The "Staging" Black Hole: Guests added via guest-collector.tsx go to a "Suggestions" tab that might be missed if the couple isn't actively looking for the notification.Simplification Strategy:The "Inbox" Pattern: Treat all parent-added guests as "New Notifications" or an "Inbox" directly on the main Guest List. Instead of a separate tab, show a banner: "12 new guests suggested by Mom. [Review Now]"3. Design System & Scalability AuditAtomic Consistency:Inconsistency Flag: The GuestListManager uses a Table view, while the GuestManagement suggestions use Cards. This inconsistency forces the user to re-learn how to read guest information twice.Missing States: There is no "Parent View" preview. The couple cannot easily see what the family member will see before they send the link.The "Long Content" Test:The "South Asian Name" Problem: Names like "Suryanarayana Venkateshwara Rao" or "The Chathoth-Kunnambath Family" will break the current TableCell layout on mobile.Fix: The UI must switch from a Table to an Expandable Card on screens smaller than 768px.4. Overhaul Strategy: "The Simple South Asian Guest Hub"To meet the needs of a South Asian couple in the US/Canada managing local and international guests/parents, I recommend the following overhaul:A. The "Parent-Safe" Magic Link (Frontend Overhaul)Instead of a generic form, the GuestCollector should look like a Digital Invitation to Help.Friction Reduction: Use a "WhatsApp-style" interface. Large buttons, voice-to-text notes for elderly parents to explain who a guest is ("Friend from Pind").Smart Recognition: If a parent adds "Mr. & Mrs. Sharma," the system should automatically propose a Household of 2.B. The "Review Staging" (The Household Inbox)Don't hide suggestions in a tab. Use an Inbox Sidebar on the main guest list.The "Side-by-Side" Approval: Show the suggested guest next to the current count. "Adding this household will put you at 305/300 guests. Accept anyway?"Family Conflict Resolution: Allow the couple to "Park" a guest with a private note: "Discuss with Dad before declining."C. Household-First ArchitectureIn South Asian weddings, you rarely invite one person; you invite a "Ghar" (House).The UI Overhaul: The primary view should be Households, with "Guests" nested inside.Simple Logic: "The Patel Family (4 seats)." One click to send one Magic Link to the whole family to collect their individual names and dietary needs.D. The "Capacity Thermometer"Replace complex budget tables with a simple visual "Thermometer."Blue: Bride's Side (Allocated vs. Used)Pink: Groom's Side (Allocated vs. Used)Red: Over-capacity warning.This appeals to the "fairness" and "quota" management common in South Asian wedding politics.
