1. The Strategy: Why "Standard" Budgets FailTo make this work, the architecture must support:Multi-Event Fragmentation: Users must be able to tag expenses to specific events (Sangeet, Vidhi, Nikkah, Reception).The "Contribution" Model: In South Asian cultures, parents often pay for specific items (e.g., "The Bride's side covers the Sangeet"). The UI must reflect who is paying for what.Cash Flow Management: Unlike Western weddings where the final bill is paid at the end, South Asian weddings involve many "envelopes" of cash and numerous small deposits.2. Feature ArchitectureFeatureFunctionalityEvent-Based BucketsCategorize costs by event (e.g., Haldi vs. Wedding Day).Collaborative LedgerGranular permissions so parents can see only the events they are funding.Traditional Category DefaultsAuto-populate items like Mithai, Milni gifts, and Out-of-town guest transport.The "Cash Envelope" TrackerA specific toggle for items traditionally paid in cash on the day of.3. The Wireframe ConceptSince I am a text-based AI, I will describe the High-Fidelity Wireframe logic for the "Budget Dashboard."Screen 1: The Macro View (The "At-a-Glance" Dashboard)Top Nav: "Total Budget" vs. "Spent" vs. "Remaining" (Progress bar style).The "Who's Paying" Carousel: Circular avatars of the Couple, Groom's Parents, and Bride's Parents. Tapping one filters the entire budget to show only their contributions.Event Breakdown (Horizontal Scroll): * Sangeet: $12,000 | Ceremony: $25,000 | Reception: $45,000.Screen 2: The Itemized Ledger (The "Micro" View)Categorization: Instead of just "Flowers," we use "Decor & Mandap."Sticky Header: Total amount paid so far.Line Items:Vendor Name (Link to vendor profile).Payment Status Pill: (Deposit Paid / Balance Due / Paid in Full)."Cash Reserve" Icon: A small money-wing icon indicating if this needs to be a physical cash payment on the wedding day.4. The User Experience (UX) Secret SauceIn my experience, the "Aha!" moment for a South Asian bride or groom is Tax & Gratuity transparency. Many apps show a $10,000 catering bill, but in North America, with 22% service fees and 8% tax, that's actually $13,000.My Design Intervention:The "Real Cost" Toggle: A global switch that automatically calculates and adds estimated tax and service fees to every line item so the couple isn't blindsided 30 days before the wedding.
